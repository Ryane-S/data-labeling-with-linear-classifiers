## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of simple linear classifiers for automatic data labeling. 
The goal is to provide an intuitive understanding of fundamental classification methods, including nearest neighbor classification, KNN, and multiclass linear classifiers trained with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) loss.

All models are implemented from scratch in Python and evaluated on unseen data to analyze their classification performance.
