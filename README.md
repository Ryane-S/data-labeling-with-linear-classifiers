## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of simple linear classifiers for automatic data labeling. 
The goal is to provide an intuitive understanding of fundamental classification methods, including:

- **Nearest Neighbor and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** applied to the **CIFAR-10** dataset for image classification.
- **Multiclass linear classifiers trained with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) loss** applied to the **Iris** dataset.

All models are implemented from scratch in Python and evaluated on unseen data to analyze their classification performance.
